# Retirement Calculator

## Inspiration

The inspiration for the Retirement Calculator came from the realization that planning for retirement is a complex task that requires careful consideration of many factors, including income, expenses, savings, investments, and more. We wanted to create a tool that simplifies this process and helps users make informed decisions about their retirement planning.

## What it does

The Retirement Calculator is a web application that allows users to input their financial information, including income from various sources, monthly expenses, savings, and investments. The application calculates key financial metrics, such as net income, savings rate, and estimated annual return on investments. It also provides a visual representation of these metrics over time, helping users understand how their financial situation might evolve in the future.

## How we built it

We built the Retirement Calculator using Streamlit, a Python library for creating web applications. We used pandas for data manipulation and numpy for numerical calculations. The user interface consists of input fields for the user to enter their financial information, and the output is displayed in the form of metrics and charts.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the main challenges we faced was ensuring that the calculations were accurate and reflected the complexities of financial planning. We also had to make sure that the user interface was intuitive and easy to use, even for users with no financial background.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of creating a tool that can potentially help many people with their retirement planning. We're also proud of the user-friendly interface and the accurate calculations that take into account various factors.

## What we learned

Through this project, we learned a lot about financial planning and the importance of preparing for retirement. We also improved our skills in Python programming and learned how to use Streamlit to create interactive web applications.

## What's next for Retirement Calculator

In the future, we plan to add more features to the Retirement Calculator, such as the ability to factor in different retirement scenarios and the impact of inflation. We also plan to improve the user interface and make the application even more user-friendly.
